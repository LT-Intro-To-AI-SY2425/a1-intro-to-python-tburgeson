# Assignment 1 - Write UP

## Description
This is the portion of the assignment that will be graded.  I will be looking at your other files, and specifically either `a1.py` or `a1_ai_problems.py`.  I will be looking to see that you completed the problems or used a generative AI to help you come up with and complete some challenge questions.  This document will help guide you through that process.

## Options for Assignment 1
- Complete the `a1.py` file completely and answer the reflection questions in this file.  Mr. Berg will be looking at both files.
- Complete the `python_with_generative_ai.md` and put your programming portions in `a1_ai_problems.py`.

Mr. Berg will look at all your files to determine what you have completed.  If there are any questions for this assignment, Mr. Berg will ask in class after he grades them.


## Reflection Questions

1. What is your initial thoughts about the python programming language?
I think python is much easier to program in than something like Java, which is what I'm used to. Java doesn't do a lot of things for you, at least how we used it in CSA, and Python has a lot more ease-of-use functions that I've noticed just from the start. It's interesting how much nicer it is to use.

2. Describe some similarities and differences that you found between python and other programming languages you have used in the past?
I've mainly used Java, but Python still has similarities to it. Loops fundamentally work the same way, and iterating through objects is similar. Python definitely improves on this a lot, but the core concepts are the same. It's overall very different, though. I like the lack of semicolons, even though it took work to get out of that habit. I also like the indentation as part of the language structure, and the condensations of functions to one line that usually took up multiple lines and indents.

3. What are some things that you learned through this assignment?
I learned more about python slicing, which is really useful. It makes dealing with strings and lists so much easier, especially compared to Java-type languages. I also learned more about different types of loops, like "for i in range" which allows you to be much more specific about loop structures. I also learned about dealing with ChatGPT in a different, technical sense. I haven't used it for programming troubleshooting before so it was a new experience for sure.
